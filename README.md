## HOW TO USE IT
1. fork this repo and git clone to your mac
2. change directory and run script "npm install" to install all the dependencies
3. run script "webpack" to build the bundle.js using webpack
4. run script "mongod" to run mongodb locally
5. run script "npm test" to run all the test cases
5. run script "npm start" to start server
6. go to browser and visit http://localhost:8080

Notice: Due to security reason, signing up a new account on the sign up page will only create regular user account. However, once the server starts, a new admin account "admin" / "Gx1234" will be generated. You can log in the admin account, you can use the "add admin" button to make other regular user to become admin users<br />
